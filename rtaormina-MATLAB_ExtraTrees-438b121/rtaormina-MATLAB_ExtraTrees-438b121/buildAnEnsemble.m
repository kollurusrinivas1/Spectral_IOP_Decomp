% Builds an ensemble of Extra-Trees for regression or classification
% datasets
%  
% Inputs : 
% M             = number of trees in the ensemble
% K             = number of attributes randomly selected at each node
% nmin          = minimum sample size for splitting a node
% data          = calibration dataset (targets are in the last column) 
% problemType   = specify problem type (1 for regression, zero for classification)
% inputType     = binary vector indicating feature type(0:categorical,1:numerical)
% sampleWeights = weights of the samples (used for IterativeInputSelection)
% only include input type for classification problems
% 
%
% Outputs : 
% ensemble  = the ensemble, which is a M-long array of Extra-Tree structs  
%             (see buildAnExtraTree for the details regarding each field)   
% output    = predictions of the ensemble on the training data set
