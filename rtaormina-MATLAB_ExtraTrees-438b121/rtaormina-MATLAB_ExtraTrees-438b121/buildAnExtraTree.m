function [TREE,output,scores,depth] = buildAnExtraTree(K,nmin,data,nodeDepth,problemType,inputType,sampleWeights)
% 
% Builds an Extra-Tree recursively and returns the predictions (or class prediction) on the 
% training data set, as well as the scores associated with each candidate input
%  
% Inputs : 
% K             = number of attributes randomly selected at each node
% nmin          = minimum sample size for splitting a node
% data          = calibration dataset (targets are in the last column) 
% nodeDepth     = depth of the current node 
% problemType   = specify problem type (1 for regression, zero for classification)
% inputType     = binary vector indicating feature type (0:categorical, 1:numerical)
% sampleWeights = weights of the samples (used for IterativeInputSelection)
% only include input type for classification problems
%
% Omit all inputs to preallocate memory. The parameter nodeDepth should be omitted 
% when calling the function from the main script, and it is used only when the function calls itself. 
% 
%
% Outputs : 
% TREE       = the Extra-Tree, which is a nested STRUCT of nodes with the 
%              following fields   
%               
%               child1, child2 = children nodes (set to NaN for leaf nodes)
%               splitAtt   = column of the attribute used for the split
%               splitAttIsCategorical = 0 if the attribute is categorical,
%               1 if continous
%               splitVal   = value used for the split
%               isLeaf     = binary digit identifying a leaf
%               leafValue  = class distribution at the leaf
%               
% 
% output      = TREE class predictions on the training data set
%
% scores      = Information Gain associated with each candidate input
